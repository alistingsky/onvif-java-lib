# ONVIF Java Library
ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) is a community to standardize communication between IP-based security products (like cameras).

This project aims to improve https://github.com/milg0/onvif-java-lib.<br>
My wish is to help other developers willing to contribute to an enterprise-level Java library for ONVIF devices.
